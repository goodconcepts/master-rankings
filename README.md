PHP Script to automate rankings of sports results by master athletes

Version 0.1 of this PHP script was created by Denise van der Linden-Morris to automate sorting tasks when creating master data rankings as a volunteer for the Dutch Athletics Federation.

Although Denise has some basic programming knowledge she doesn't work as a programmer on a day-to-day basis and could use some help improving it. In return she makes the script available to a broader audience so also other people creating rankings can use it to automate their efforts.
